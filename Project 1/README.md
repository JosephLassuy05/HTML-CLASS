Activity 6. Reviews

What you have learned in this lesson:

A web page is a text document with proper file extension, "htm" or "html".
The first line in an HTML file should be the declaration <!DOCTYPE html>.
The second tag should be the <html> ... </html> and everything should go inside there.
A web page has two parts, the head and the body.
The head is defined by the <head> ... </head> tag, and the body is defined by the <body> ... </body> tag.
Header tags specify the titles and subtitles of a web page contents.
Paragraph and line break tags format text.
An HTML file is "white space insensitive".
An inline style sets the style of an HTML element.
Activity 7. Create a Resume
Using all the tags you have learned, create a basic resume web page for yourself. As a reference, you may take a look at Resume Sample.html
 and its HTML codes ResumeSample.txt
.

Your resume document should have all the necessary tags: the doctype, the html, the head, the title, the body and all the other tags you have learned from the videos. Please do not use Word or other word processor to create the document. Learning the html tags and the structure of a html document are more important here.

Save your resume document as yourname_resume.html. Submit it to HTML I dropbox.

Files to be submit for HTML I dropbox: 
1. myfirst.html
2. yourname_resume.html.
